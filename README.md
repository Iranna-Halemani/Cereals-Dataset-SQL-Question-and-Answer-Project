# Cereals-Dataset-SQL-Question-and-Answer-Project
Hello everyone! 
I’m excited to share my project on the Cereals Dataset, where I’ve explored and analyzed various aspects of cereals using SQL queries. In this project, I’ve answered common questions related to cereals, their nutritional content, and other relevant information.

Project Overview:
Dataset: The Cereals Dataset contains information about different cereal brands, including their nutritional attributes, ratings, and manufacturer details.

Objective: My goal was to extract meaningful insights from this dataset using SQL queries.

Approach:
I used SQL to perform data manipulation, aggregation, joints and filtering.
I answered questions such as:
“Which cereals have the highest fiber content?”
“What is the average sugar content across all cereals?”
“Which manufacturer produces the most highly rated cereals?”
“Count how many are cold cereals?”
“Count how many cereals are kept in shelf 3?”
“Arrange the table from high to low according to ratings?”
“Suggest some column/s which can be Primary key?”
etc.

Repository Contents:
SQL Queries: You’ll find a set of SQL scripts that I used to analyze the dataset.
Results: I’ve included both raw query results and visualizations (if applicable).
README: This document provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the queries, and insights gained.
Feel free to explore the repository, run the queries, and share your feedback!
